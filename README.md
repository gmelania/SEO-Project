# Search Engine Optimization 

This project is made by a team of 3 students from the faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science. The aim of this project is to improve the quality of a given website, by checking its containing links, and returning a log to the developer so that he can fix them in the shortest amount or time, or to help a search engine differentiate between a good link and a bad link, and show to the user only the good and accesible links.
